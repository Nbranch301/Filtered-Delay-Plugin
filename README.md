# Filtered-Delay-Plugin
This effect plugin is designed to be used in DAWs to add a delay effect to music tracks. It allows the user to manipulate the length and decay of the delay. It also provides High and Low Pass filters to isolate certain frequencies in the delay tail. Users can adjust the volume of the original signal and mix it with the wet delay effect. Enjoy!
